<br />
<br />
**Profit Margin & Gross Profit**
<br />
Profit margin shows a company's profitability, ie revenue - costs. However, profit margins rarely tell the full story as a company can be doing well but not be profitable. Fun fact: Uber only recently became profitable!
<br />
**Diluted EPS & P/E Ratio**
<br />
Diluted EPS and P/E Ratio are best used when comparing companies of the same industry/sector or comparing historical data for the same company. It is important to note that the P/E ratio is a trailing indicator, meaning it is calcuated using only historical data, which means it doesn't take into account any forward-looking expectations.
<br />
**EMA**
